### Binary Tree implemented using Iterator pattern
[Iterator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20the,and%20thus%20cannot%20be%20decoupled.) is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements, without knowing it's inner implementations.

Using the design pattern, following traversal have been implemented
* Preorder traversal
* Inorder traversal
* Postorder traversal
* Breadth First traversal
